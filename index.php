				Our body is highly intelligent and self-balancing. We all have experienced its natural healing ability such as when we let a cut or a cold heal “by itself”. However, the body can get stuck during this process. Sometimes the task is too large or our ways from the past are no longer effective. Our body and our Inner Wisdom signal what is out of balance through physical and emotional symptoms. Delia reads these signs and, in the most nurturing way, provides efficient support for your body to do what it knows best: self-healing.

				Delia also helps you to understand the symptoms and what might have led to your discomfort. Is there a specific position or activity that creates tension in your body? Do you hold an idea, a belief or an emotion that restricts your natural evolution? In this case Somato Emotional Release, dialog and imagery are is useful to develop your physical and emotional awareness, giving you the power to deeply change to a more comfortable, creative and productive version of yourself.
