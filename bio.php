			<h2>How can Manual Therapy help You?</h2>

				Delia’s career as a manual therapist rose from her extensive on-going research of ways to develop the body, mind and soul’s wellbeing and power. She is currently developing ways to integrate the most recent discoveries in biology and quantum physics into the healing arts.

				Delia was born and raised in Normandy, France. Her dedication to healing arts was naturally born during her former career, as a dancer for the Opera of Paris and the Martha Graham Ensemble when she experienced the tremendous wear and tear placed upon an athlete’s body. To add to this demanding lifestyle, after years of unexplained pain, she was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis and received traditional treatment for several years. Refusing to trade her active life with the one of a patient crippled by a chronic autoimmune illness and the high doses of anti-inflammatory medication she was prescribed, Delia sought out alternative therapies and discovered Manual Therapy which included osteopathy and energy work. After a few years of extensive healing, she was finally free from pain and medications. This challenging experience allowed her to find her inner voice. Upon retiring from dance, Delia was ready to share with the world her explorations in the profound, nurturing, life changing potential of the art of Manual Therapy.
