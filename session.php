			<h2>What Can You Expect In A Session?</h2>
			<p>
				Manual therapy is a gentle noninvasive hands-on therapy performed on a massage table. This approach supports the body to allow its natural healing process to bring you back to vibrant health. Manual Therapy includes osteopathic techniques such as Craniosacral and Visceral Manipulation. Delia’s work is enhanced by her extensive knowledge and practice of massage, Reiki and meditation.
			</p>
			<p>	
				Manual Therapy aims to address the primary cause of the pain and gain lasting results. Often this can lead to focus away from the location of the pain itself to resolve the underlying cause. Each session alleviates restrictions to restore inner energy flow. As a result, the entire body is integrated towards seamless communication and better ”team work”. The nervous and endocrine systems orchestrate more efficiently.  Blood and lymph circulation are facilitated. All tissues relax, while their nutrition delivery and detoxification improve.

				Delia’s touch ranges from light with manual therapy and energy work to deep with massage and deep tissue techniques, according to your body’s need.
