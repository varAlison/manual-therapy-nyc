			<h2>About</h2>
			<h3>Why Manual Therapy?</h3>
			<p>
				Our body is highly intelligent and self-balancing. We all have experienced its natural healing ability such as when we let a cut or a cold heal “by itself”. However, the body can get stuck during this process. Sometimes the task is too large or our ways from the past are no longer effective. Our body and our Inner Wisdom signal what is out of balance through physical and emotional symptoms. Delia reads these signs and, in the most nurturing way, provides efficient support for your body to do what it knows best: self-healing.
			</p>
			<p>	
				Delia also helps you to understand the symptoms and what might have led to your discomfort. Is there a specific position or activity that creates tension in your body? Do you hold an idea, a belief or an emotion that restricts your natural evolution? In this case Somato Emotional Release, dialog and imagery are is useful to develop your physical and emotional awareness, giving you the power to deeply change to a more comfortable, creative and productive version of yourself.

			<h2>Session</h2>
			<h3>What Can You Expect In A Session?</h3>
			<p>
				Manual therapy is a gentle noninvasive hands-on therapy performed on a massage table. This approach supports the body to allow its natural healing process to bring you back to vibrant health. Manual Therapy includes osteopathic techniques such as Craniosacral and Visceral Manipulation. Delia’s work is enhanced by her extensive knowledge and practice of massage, Reiki and meditation.
			</p>
			<p>	
				Manual Therapy aims to address the primary cause of the pain and gain lasting results. Often this can lead to focus away from the location of the pain itself to resolve the underlying cause. Each session alleviates restrictions to restore inner energy flow. As a result, the entire body is integrated towards seamless communication and better ”team work”. The nervous and endocrine systems orchestrate more efficiently.  Blood and lymph circulation are facilitated. All tissues relax, while their nutrition delivery and detoxification improve.
			</p>	
			<p>
				Delia’s touch ranges from light with manual therapy and energy work to deep with massage and deep tissue techniques, according to your body’s need.

			<h2>Conditions</h2>
			<h3>How Can Manual Therapy Help You?</h3>
			<p>
				A very wide range of conditions can be helped with Manual therapy. This respectful approach releases tensions and restrictions and provides the ideal environment for the nervous system to relax and rejuvenate. The central nervous system is the body’s command center. When it is rebalanced, all other systems in the body will be helped and all conditions will improve. Many people come to Delia when other techniques have not worked. Manual Therapy relieves pain, promotes whole-body health and increases resistance to disease without the use of medications or invasive procedures. That’s why it has become part of the wellness routine for athletes, artists and lay people alike.

			<h3>How can Manual Therapy help You?</h3>
			<p>
				Delia’s career as a manual therapist rose from her extensive on-going research of ways to develop the body, mind and soul’s wellbeing and power. She is currently developing ways to integrate the most recent discoveries in biology and quantum physics into the healing arts.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Delia studied osteopathic techniques with the Upledger Institute, and at the Barral and Chikly Institute. Delia is a New York Licensed Massage Therapist and a graduate of the Swedish Institute College of Health Sciences in New York City. There she was trained in the Western modalities of massage including deep tissue and Swedish massage, sport and rehabilitation techniques as well as the Eastern modalities of Chinese medicine and shiatsu. Delia has practiced meditation for over 15 years and is also a Reiki Master.
			</p>
			<p>
				Delia was born and raised in Normandy, France. Her dedication to healing arts was naturally born during her former career, as a dancer for the Opera of Paris and the Martha Graham Ensemble when she experienced the tremendous wear and tear placed upon an athlete’s body. To add to this demanding lifestyle, after years of unexplained pain, she was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis and received traditional treatment for several years. Refusing to trade her active life with the one of a patient crippled by a chronic autoimmune illness and the high doses of anti-inflammatory medication she was prescribed, Delia sought out alternative therapies and discovered Manual Therapy which included osteopathy and energy work. After a few years of extensive healing, she was finally free from pain and medications. This challenging experience allowed her to find her inner voice. Upon retiring from dance, Delia was ready to share with the world her explorations in the profound, nurturing, life changing potential of the art of Manual Therapy.
